The first doubt is about the text with the red highlighted (i.e.受試者分三組)
(1)What is the way they perform the experiment? Randomized Experiment (隨機實驗)?
It is better that mentions the way they use in above link since it is more detailed.
There are some potential considerations that affect the result greatly.

The second doubt is about the sentences with the yellow highlighted (i.e.前兩組對於漂綠訊息比較「有識別力」，但與對照組的差異並不大) 
(P.S.sorry for my carelessness, some texts are NOT yellow highlighted.)
(2)Are there no huge differences between the first, second group and third group such that we can almost ignore others consideration?
The article mentions the there are no huge differences between first, second and third group.
What is the exact number of differences?
